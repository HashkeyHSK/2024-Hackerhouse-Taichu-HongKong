## Overview
Likwid Protocol, through liquidity pools based on Uniswap V4, provides a fully decentralized derivatives mechanism that requires neither counterparties nor oracles, greatly enhancing user flexibility in risk management and asset allocation. Likwid Protocol uses a pooled funds model, meaning that the liquidity provided by users is consolidated into a shared pool, and other users can borrow these funds for short-selling or leveraged trading. With this pooled mechanism, loans do not need to be matched individually between borrowers and lenders but instead rely on the total liquidity in the pool and users' collateral. This model allows for instant loan operations based on the poolâ€™s status, maximizing capital efficiency.
