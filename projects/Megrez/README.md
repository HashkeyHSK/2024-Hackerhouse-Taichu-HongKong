## Overview
This project collects users’ sleep data through wearable devices (such as wristbands and rings) and links it with relevant health apps. It generates tokens to incentivize users to maintain healthy sleep habits, improve deep sleep duration, and ensure physical health. The tokens are used to encourage users to sleep well each night and can be exchanged on relevant platforms for different levels of beds, bedding, bedrooms, and other metaverse components, with additional features such as transfer and synthesis gameplay.
