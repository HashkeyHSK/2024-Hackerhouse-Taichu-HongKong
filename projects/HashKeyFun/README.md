# **HashKeyFun**  
*Building a Safer Meme Coin Platform on the HashKey Chain*

---

## **Overview**  
Our project is an innovative meme coin platform built on the **HashKey Chain**, similar to how **Pumpfun** operates on the Solana chain. While Pumpfun has significantly boosted TVL in the Solana ecosystem, it lacks content safeguards against obscene or violent meme content. **HashKeyFun** addresses this by employing a **dual-layer content verification system**.

---

### **Key Differentiators**  
1. **Content Verification System**  
   - **AI-Based Checks**: Initial filter for obscenity/violence  
   - **Administrator Review**: Human oversight for final approval  
2. **Decentralized Ecosystem**  
   - Free issuance & trading after verification  
3. **Enhanced Ecosystem Credibility**  
   - Builds trust, increases liquidity, and fosters active user participation on the **HashKey Chain**  

---

## **Problem Solved: Decentralized Token Factory**  
Pumpfun’s shortcoming lies in the absence of a content verification framework. This can tarnish the platform’s and the chain’s credibility due to potentially inappropriate content.  

**HashKeyFun** solves this by blending the strengths of both centralized and decentralized approaches:
- **Centralized Review Phase**: Quick, accountable approvals  
- **Fully Decentralized Execution**: Ensures transparency, security, and user autonomy  

---

## **Implementation Details**  

### 1. **AI-Based Obscenity and Violence Detection**  
- **NLP Algorithms**:  
  Utilizes **BERT** and **GPT** family models to analyze text content for obscene language or violent expressions.  
- **Scoring System**:  
  Obscenity/violence is quantified; if a threshold is exceeded, content is automatically rejected.  

### 2. **Administrator Review & Final Approval**  
- **Second Layer of Verification**:  
  Content flagged by the AI is manually reviewed.  
- **Human Insight**:  
  Even content deemed safe by AI requires an administrator's stamp of approval prior to listing.  

This **hybrid approach** delivers both **reliability** (through human oversight) and **efficiency** (through AI automation).

---

## **How We Differ From Pumpfun**  
While **Pumpfun** enhances liquidity, it overlooks content safety, risking platform credibility. By contrast, **HashKeyFun** provides:

- **Dual-Layer Verification**: Combining AI and human checks  
- **Preservation of Decentralization**: Tokens are still issued/traded freely post-verification  
- **Long-Term Ecosystem Value**: Encourages higher **TVL**, user trust, and overall sustainability  

---

## **Conclusion**  
**HashKeyFun** offers an innovative and secure meme coin framework on the **HashKey Chain**. By combining **AI-based verification** with **human oversight**, we ensure the platform’s **reliability** and **fairness** while retaining the **advantages of decentralization**.

In doing so, we contribute to the HashKey Chain ecosystem by:
- Boosting **TVL**  
- Driving **transaction growth**  
- Enhancing **user trust**  

Our ultimate goal? **Cultivate a healthier and more sustainable chain ecosystem**, far beyond just facilitating meme coin trading.
