# Greedy World

## Overview

The shell of Greedy World is a Snake game, which at its heart is a tool to help the tokens flow.
You’ll control a snake in the game, attack your opponent and snatch his tokens.
You must find the black hole and leave with your loot as soon as possible, or you will be targeted by another greedy villain.
It’s as simple as that!
