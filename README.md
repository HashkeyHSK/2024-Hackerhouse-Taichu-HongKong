# Polyflow

## Overview
PolyFlow is the first PayFi infrastructure designed to seamlessly connect RWA (Real-World Assets) with DeFi. It achieves this by introducing two core products: PID (Payment ID) as the gateway for compliance access and PLP (PolyFlow Liquidity Pool) as the entry point for fund custody. PolyFlow pioneers a new financial paradigm, evolving from "Buy Now, Pay Later" to "Buy Now, Pay Never."
